To demonstrate that the specified Boolean function cannot generally be computed with a single perceptron, we can consider
a simple counter-example. Recall that a single perceptron can only compute linearly separable functions. A function is
linearly separable if there exists a hyperplane that can separate the input space into two parts, each corresponding to
one of the output classes.

Let's consider a specific case of the Boolean function described, with D = 2, A = 0, and B = 0. In this case, the function
outputs 1 if the sum of the two variables is 0, and -1 otherwise. The input space consists of four points:
{(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)}, corresponding to all possible combinations of the two Boolean variables.

For these inputs, the function outputs are as follows:
- f(-1, -1) = -1 (sum is -2)
- f(-1, 1) = 1 (sum is 0)
- f(1, -1) = 1 (sum is 0)
- f(1, 1) = -1 (sum is 2)

If we try to plot these points in a two-dimensional space, where each axis represents one of the variables, we'll see
that there is no straight line (hyperplane in 2D) that can separate the points with output 1 from those with output -1.
The points (-1, 1) and (1, -1) would be on one side of the line, and the points (-1, -1) and (1, 1) would be on the other
side. However, this does not correspond to the correct classification according to the function f.

Since there is no linear separator for this function, a single perceptron, which can only represent linear decision
boundaries, cannot compute this function. This example demonstrates that the given Boolean function cannot generally be
computed with a single perceptron, as it is not linearly separable in all cases.
